I woke up at 6:30 a.m to do my prayer
At 9.00 a.m, I took a bath to get ready for my classes
I'm in a programming class from 10:30 a.m till 12:30 p.m
I take a break for 30 minutes before attend to other classes
At 1:30 p.m, I eat my lunch
After my lunch, I will do my prayer
I will attend my classes from 2:30 p.m until 5:30
And I will take a break again

At 8.00p.m, I will start doing my programming work until 10.00p.m
At 10:30p.m, I will get ready to sleep
That is how I spent my one-day campus life.
